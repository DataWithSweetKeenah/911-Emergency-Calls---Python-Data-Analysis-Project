## Description 
This project analyzes 911 emergency call data from Montgomery County, PA. Using Python and powerful data visualization tools, I uncover call patterns by time, location, and emergency type. This analysis supports better resource allocation for EMS, Fire, and Traffic-related emergencies.

## Overview 
911 calls represent crucial real-time data on emergencies in any region. By analyzing this dataset, we can identify which emergencies occur most frequently, when they peak, and how they vary by location. These insights can help first responders and local authorities make data-driven decisions.

## Problem Statement 
Emergency resources are limited. Without understanding where, when, and why calls are made, it’s hard to allocate the right resources. This project aims to:
- Identify high-call zones and time periods.
- Understand seasonal and weekly patterns.
- Suggest how emergency departments can prepare more effectively.

## Objective 
- Clean and transform the dataset for analysis.
- Explore patterns in EMS, Fire, and Traffic-related calls.
- Visualize 911 call trends over time and across locations.
- Provide actionable recommendations based on insights.

## Tools
- Language: Python.
- Libraries: pandas, NumPy, seaborn, matplotlib.
- Environment: Jupyter Notebook.
- (Optional additions: Plotly for interactive charts, Streamlit for dashboard).
